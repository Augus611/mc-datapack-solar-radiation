## Intro
**Welcome to Solar Radiation!**

You find yourself in a post apocalyptic world. The planet has moved closer to the sun, the earth's atmosphere has thinned and with it, the protection it provided.

Solar radiation is poisonous and can lead to death, so to survive in this new world you will have to avoid the sun as much as possible. Live under ground or in shelters and only venture out at night.

## Data pack goal
This data pack adds new radiation mechanics designed to encourage players to venture out at night and make preparations before braving the sunlight.

Build a secure bunker, a grand underground city or revert to a cave dwelling lifestyle. 
As always, how you chose to play is up to you, now you simply have a new threat to take into consideration!


## Features
### Radiation mechanic
The sun is toxic, if you stay under the sun for too long you will gain radiation poisoning which will bring you several side effects.

### Radiation spread
If you get radiation poisoning, not only will your health suffer, but you may risk spreading the sickness to nearby mobs. Always be aware of your radiation level and develop a protocol to avoid incidents.

### Hazmat suits
Need to go outside? The you may want to dress for the occasion. You can craft hazmat suits that will keep you safe. However, nothing lasts for ever so you may need to keep an eye on your equipment durability.

### Decontamination potions
To quickly clear radiation poisoning you will need to brew decontamination potions. This will let you clear all radiations from players and mobs.

### Advancements
Custom advancements will guide players through the new mechanics as well as offer some end goals.
